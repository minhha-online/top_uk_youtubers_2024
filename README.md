# Objective 

The Head of Marketing wants to find out who the top YouTubers are in 2024 to decide on which YouTubers would be best to run marketing campaigns throughout the rest of the year.

To create a dashboard that provides insights into the top UK YouTubers in 2024 that includes their 
- subscriber count
- total views
- total videos, and
- engagement metrics
  
This will help the marketing team make informed decisions about which YouTubers to collaborate with for their marketing campaigns.

## User story 

As the Head of Marketing, I want to use a dashboard that analyses YouTube channel data in the UK . 

This dashboard should allow me to identify the top performing channels based on metrics like subscriber base and average views. 

With this information, I can make more informed decisions about which Youtubers are right to collaborate with, and therefore maximize how effective each marketing campaign is.


# Data source 

We need data on the top UK YouTubers in 2024 that includes their 
- channel names
- total subscribers
- total views
- total videos uploaded

The data is sourced from Kaggle (an Excel extract), [see here to find it.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavyadhingra00020/top-100-social-media-influencers-2024-countrywise?resource=download)


# Stages

- Design
- Developement
- Testing
- Analysis 
 


# Design 

## Dashboard components required 

To understand what it should contain, we need to figure out what questions we need the dashboard to answer:

1. Who are the top 10 YouTubers with the most subscribers?
2. Which 3 channels have uploaded the most videos?
3. Which 3 channels have the most views?
4. Which 3 channels have the highest average views per video?
5. Which 3 channels have the highest views per subscriber ratio?
6. Which 3 channels have the highest subscriber engagement rate per video uploaded?

For now, these are some of the questions we need to answer, this may change as we progress down our analysis. 


## Dashboard mockup

- What should it look like? 

Some of the data visuals that may be appropriate in answering our questions include:

1. Table
2. Treemap
3. Scorecards
4. Horizontal bar chart 




![Dashboard-Mockup](assets/images/dashboard_mockup.png)


## Tools 


| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Excel | Exploring the data |
| SQL Server | Cleaning, testing, and analyzing the data |
| Power BI | Visualizing the data via interactive dashboards |
| GitHub | Hosting the project documentation and version control |
| Mokkup AI | Designing the wireframe/mockup of the dashboard | 


# Development

## Pseudocode

- The general approach in creating this solution from start to finish:

1. Get the data
2. Explore the data in Excel
3. Load the data into SQL Server
4. Clean the data with SQL
5. Test the data with SQL
6. Visualize the data in Power BI
7. Generate the findings based on the insights
8. Write the documentation + commentary
9. Publish the data to GitHub Pages

## Data exploration

This is the stage where you have a scan of what's in the data, errors, inconcsistencies, bugs, weird and corrupted characters etc  

1. There are at least 4 columns that contain the data we need for this analysis, which signals we have everything we need from the file without needing to contact the client for any more data. 
2. The first column contains the channel ID with what appears to be channel IDS, which are separated by a @ symbol - we need to extract the channel names from this.
3. Some of the cells and header names are in a different language - we need to confirm if these columns are needed, and if so, we need to address them.
4. We have more data than we need, so some of these columns would need to be removed

## Data cleaning 

The aim is to refine our dataset to ensure it is structured and ready for analysis. 

The cleaned data should meet the following criteria and constraints:

- Only relevant columns should be retained.
- All data types should be appropriate for the contents of each column.
- No column should contain null values, indicating complete data for all records.

Below is a table outlining the constraints on our cleaned dataset:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Number of Rows | 100 |
| Number of Columns | 4 |

And here is a tabular representation of the expected schema for the clean data:

| Column Name | Data Type | Nullable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channel_name | VARCHAR | NO |
| total_subscribers | INTEGER | NO |
| total_views | INTEGER | NO |
| total_videos | INTEGER | NO |


- Steps are needed to clean and shape the data into the desired format:

1. Remove unnecessary columns by only selecting the ones you need
2. Extract Youtube channel names from the first column
3. Rename columns using aliases







### Transform the data 



```sql
/*
# 1. Select the required columns
# 2. Extract the channel name from the 'NOMBRE' column
*/

-- 1.
SELECT
    SUBSTRING(NOMBRE, 1, CHARINDEX('@', NOMBRE) -1) AS channel_name,  -- 2.
    total_subscribers,
    total_views,
    total_videos

FROM
    top_uk_youtubers_2024
```


### Create the SQL view 

```sql
/*
# 1. Create a view to store the transformed data
# 2. Cast the extracted channel name as VARCHAR(100)
# 3. Select the required columns from the top_uk_youtubers_2024 SQL table 
*/

-- 1.
CREATE VIEW view_uk_youtubers_2024 AS

-- 2.
SELECT
    CAST(SUBSTRING(NOMBRE, 1, CHARINDEX('@', NOMBRE) -1) AS VARCHAR(100)) AS channel_name, -- 2. 
    total_subscribers,
    total_views,
    total_videos

-- 3.
FROM
    top_uk_youtubers_2024

```


# Testing 

Here are the data quality tests conducted:

## Row count check
```sql
/*
# Count the total number of records (or rows) are in the SQL view
*/

SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS no_of_rows
FROM
    view_uk_youtubers_2024;

```

![Row count check](assets/images/1_row_count_check.png)



## Column count check
### SQL query 
```sql
/*
# Count the total number of columns (or fields) are in the SQL view
*/


SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS column_count
FROM
    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE
    TABLE_NAME = 'view_uk_youtubers_2024'
```
### Output 
![Column count check](assets/images/2_column_count_check.png)



## Data type check
### SQL query 
```sql
/*
# Check the data types of each column from the view by checking the INFORMATION SCHEMA view
*/

-- 1.
SELECT
    COLUMN_NAME,
    DATA_TYPE
FROM
    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE
    TABLE_NAME = 'view_uk_youtubers_2024';
```
### Output
![Data type check](assets/images/3_data_type_check.png)


## Duplicate count check
### SQL query 
```sql
/*
# 1. Check for duplicate rows in the view
# 2. Group by the channel name
# 3. Filter for groups with more than one row
*/

-- 1.
SELECT
    channel_name,
    COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM
    view_uk_youtubers_2024

-- 2.
GROUP BY
    channel_name

-- 3.
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 1;
```

## Discovery

We discovered that 


1. NoCopyrightSOunds, Dan Rhodes and DanTDM are the channnels with the most subscribers in the UK
2. GRM Daily, Man City and Yogscast are the channels with the most videos uploaded
3. DanTDM, Dan RHodes and Mister Max are the channels with the most views
4. Entertainment channels are useful for broader reach, as the channels posting consistently on their platforms and generating the most engagement are focus on entertainment and music 




## Recommendations 
  
1. Dan Rhodes is the best YouTube channel to collaborate with if we want to maximize visbility because this channel has the most YouTube subscribers in the UK
2. Although Boomerang UK, More Emily, Sing Kingx are regular publishers on YouTube, it may be worth considering whether collaborating with them with the current budget caps are worth the effort, as the potential return on investments is significantly lower compared to the other channels.
3. Mister Max is the best YouTuber to collaborate with if we're interested in maximizing reach, but collaborating with DanTDM and Dan Rhodes may be better long-term options considering the fact that they both have large subscriber bases and are averaging significantly high number of views.
4. The top 3 channels to form collaborations with are NoCopyrightSounds, DanTDM and Dan Rhodes based on this analysis, because they attract the most engagement on their channels consistently.


### Potential ROI 

1. Setting up a collaboration deal with Dan Rhodes would make the client a net profit of $1,091,000 per video
2. An influencer marketing contract with Mister Max can see the client generate a net profit of $1,252,000
3. If we go with a product placement campaign with DanTDM, this could  generate the client approximately $487,000 per video. If we advance with an influencer marketing campaign deal instead, this would make the client a one-off net profit of $407,000.
4. NoCopyrightSounds could profit the client $553,000 per video too (which is worth considering) 




### Action plan

Based on our analysis, we beieve the best channel to advance a long-term partnership deal with to promote the client's products is the Dan Rhodes channel. 

We'll have conversations with the marketing client to forecast what they also expect from this collaboration. Once we observe we're hitting the expected milestones, we'll advance with potential partnerships with DanTDM, Mister Max and NoCopyrightSounds channels in the future.   

- Steps we should take to implement the recommended decisions effectively:


1. Reach out to the teams behind each of these channels, starting with Dan Rhodes
2. Negotiate contracts within the budgets allocated to each marketing campaign
3. Kick off the campaigns and track each of their performances against the KPIs
4. Review how the campaigns have gone, gather insights and optimize based on feedback from converted customers and each channel's audiences
